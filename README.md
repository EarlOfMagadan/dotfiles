# dotfiles
My current i3wm setup.
A large amount of code and ideas in this repository are borrowed from other people's dotfiles. I will continue to improve the consistency of this repository and implement more scripts and ideas. I use a diverse set of programs in my daily operations.

- Shell: bash, I may switch to zsh and/or add Starship

- Terminal: Alacritty, I may switch to kitty

- Fonts: [Share Tech Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Share+Tech+Mono) and [Fixedsys](https://www.cufonfonts.com/font/fixedsys-excelsior-301)


- WM: i3wm

- Browser: Brave, I may switch to seamonkey or icecat
